This project is an electronic system for ENEL387 Microcomputer System Design based on the STM32F100 ARM Cortex-M3 micro controller and ENEL384 carrier board. My partner and I designed, implemented and deployed software to create a embedded robotic vehicle implemented in C to avoid objects using a series of digital and analog sensors. In addition to creating working software we also build the complete system from various online retailers.
